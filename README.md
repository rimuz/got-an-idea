### Got an idea - *The platform for sharing your billion dollar idea*
This simple **webapp** was programmed in **Javascript**, using the framework React.js along with the libraries *react-redux*, *react-router*, *react-helmet*, etc.

If you are curious to see it working, as long as I'm paying the bills, you can try a demo [here](https://got-an-idea.com). Feel free to interact, register and post your content on the website.

It was deployed thanks to the **Amazon Web Services** (Lambda functions in Python, an S3 bucket, a MySQL instance, a Route53 domain).
